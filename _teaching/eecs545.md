This is a graduate introduction to Machine Learning.

I am a Graduate Student Instructor for the Winter 2025 offering of this course under Professor [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/). Here's a brief outline of the course content.

* Introduction
* Regression (Linear regression, Gradient descent, Maximum likelihood)
* Classification (kNN, Naive Bayes, LDA, Logistic regression)
* Kernel methods (KDE, SVMs)
* Regularization (L1 and L2, Feature selection, Bias-Variance tradeoff)
* Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Perceptron, MLP, Backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
* Learning Theory (Sample complexity, VC Dimension, PAC Learning, Error bounds)
* Unsupervised Learning (k-Means, GMMs, Expectation Maximization, PCA, ICA, Dimensionality reduction, Autoencoders, GANs)
* Reinforcement Learning (MDPs, Value & Policy iteration, Policy gradient, Deep RL, Human feedback, Direct preference optimization)
