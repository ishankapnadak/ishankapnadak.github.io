This is a graduate course on randomized algorithms. 

I was a Graduate Student Instructor for the Fall 2024 offering of this course under Professor [Nikhil Bansal](https://bansal.engin.umich.edu/). Here's an outline of the course content.

* Basic Algorithms (checking identities, fingerprinting and pattern matching, primality testing, randomized min-cut, graph algorithms)
* Probabilistic Method (linearity of expectation, second moment method, Chernoff bounds, Lovasz local lemma)
* Occupancy problems (balls into bins, power of two choices, hashing)
* Algorithms for big data (unbiased estimators, streaming and sketching, frequency moments, JL transform)
* Online Learning (experts, bandits, online convex optimization, stochastic gradient descent)
* Interactive Proofs (graph non-isomorphism, number of unsatisfying assignments)
* Derandomization (conditional probability, k-wise independence, pseudorandom generators)
* Random walks (hitting time, 2-SAT, 3-SAT)
* Linear Algebra (fast linear regression, spectral sparsification)
* Approximation (LP/SDP rounding, basic spectral theory and optimization)
* Complexity (PCP theorem (simpler version))
