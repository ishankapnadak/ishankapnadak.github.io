I have been playing the guitar for nearly the last ten years. Even when I don't play the guitar, I love listening to music. My music taste, however, is something quite uncommon and eclectic. I mostly listen to progressive metal, rock, djent, and death metal. I also listen to some jazz and classical. I would not be able to pinpoint my favourite artist, but if I had to name a few, I would say Haken, Dream Theater, Meshuggah, Periphery, and Animals As Leaders. If you are more interested, you can follow my playlists on Apple Music and Spotify below! (I have been too lazy to make sure these are in sync, so in general there may be songs present on one that are not yet on the other).
