I have been playing the guitar for nearly the ten years, give or take. Even when I don't play the guitar, I love listening to music. I mostly listen to progressive metal, rock, djent, death metal, and jazz. I also listen to some funk and classical. I would not be able to pinpoint my favourite artist, but if I had to name a few, I would say Haken, Dream Theater, Meshuggah, Periphery, Plini, Sleep Token, Vulfpeck, and Snarky Puppy. If you are more interested, you can follow my playlists on Apple Music and Spotify below! (I have been too lazy to make sure these are in sync, so in general there may be songs present on one that are not yet on the other. EDIT: I would recommend the Apple Music one since I stopped using Spotify.).
