Hi! I'm Ishan, a senior undergraduate at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). My [research](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/research) interests are primarily in the field of artificial intelligence, with a focus on its applications in healthcare, and cognitively inspired artificial intelligence. I am also interested in math, and often find myself enjoying the rigor that the subject presents. 

I expect to graduate in May 2023, with a major in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web), a minor in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), and a minor in [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/). I spent the summer of 2021 working remotely with Professor [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj). I also had the pleasure of working under [Charles Ledoux](https://hest.ethz.ch/en/department/people/people-a-z/personen-detail.MjU0MTM0.TGlzdC8zMzQsLTQ1MTk1NTQ5OA==.html) and Professor [Ralph Müller](https://hest.ethz.ch/en/studies/health-sciences-and-technology/master-hst/majors/tutors/tutors-a-z/ralph-mueller.html) at the [Laboratory for Bone Biomechanics](https://www.bone.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in Zürich, Switzerland. I am currently also pursuing my Bachelor Thesis Project under Professor [Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/).
