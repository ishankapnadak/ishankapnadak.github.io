Hi! I'm Ishan! I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). My [research](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/research) interests are primarily in the field of artificial intelligence & its ability to positively impact the world around us. I am also interested in math, and often find myself enjoying the rigor that the subject presents. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the University of Michigan, under the guidance of Professors [Jeffrey Regier](https://regier.stat.lsa.umich.edu/) (Statistics) and [Camille Avestruz](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/cavestru.html) (Physics), with an aim to use state-of-the-art Probabilistic Machine Learning techniques to perform inference on astronomical images containing galaxy cluster fields.

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in May 2023, with a major in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web), a minor in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), and a minor in [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/). I spent the summer of 2021 working remotely with Professor [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj). I also had the pleasure of working under [Charles Ledoux](https://hest.ethz.ch/en/department/people/people-a-z/personen-detail.MjU0MTM0.TGlzdC8zMzQsLTQ1MTk1NTQ5OA==.html) and Professor [Ralph Müller](https://hest.ethz.ch/en/studies/health-sciences-and-technology/master-hst/majors/tutors/tutors-a-z/ralph-mueller.html) at the [Laboratory for Bone Biomechanics](https://www.bone.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in Zürich, Switzerland. I spent my final year at IITB pursuing my Bachelor Thesis Project under Professor [Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/). 

Aside from academics, I am also interested in music! I play the guitar, the bass, and (more recently) the drums. I have released a single in 2021, and have a couple of songs in collaboration with my peers! My music taste is quite varied, ranging from metal to jazz to classical. <a href="https://ishankapnadak.github.io/music">Find out more!</a>
