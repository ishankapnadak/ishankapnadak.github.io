This project uses an end-to-end trainable deep CNN based on the VGG network for additive Gaussian noise removal. I had worked on this project with two colleagues of mine as part of the course CS736: Medical Image Computing under Professor [Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/). The final presentation can be viewed [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/image-denoising.pdf)
