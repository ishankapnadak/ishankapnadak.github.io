In the summer following my freshman year, I also watched lectures for Professor [Vikram M. Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/vmgadre)'s offering of the course EE603: Digital Signal Processing and its Applications. Signal processing was one of the subjects I truly loved by the time I started my sophomore year, and Professor Gadre's lucid lectures have played a huge part in this. My notes for the course can be found [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/digital-signal-processing.pdf)
