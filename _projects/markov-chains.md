I took up [EE621: Markov Chains and Queueing Systems](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/courses/EE621) under Professor [Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/). The course assumes familiarity with probability theory and some mathematical rigor. I had taken this course in the semester right after the course on probability theory, and thus, this was my first exposure to applied probability, a field I am still fascinated by. My notes for the course can be viewed [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/markov-chains.pdf)
