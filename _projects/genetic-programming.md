As part of our course project for EECS 592: Foundations of AI at the University of Michigan, my peers and I tackled the problem of intelligently and automatically designing CNN architectures. We explore two evolutionary paradigms, namely (i) Cartesian Genetic Programming (which acts as a baseline), and (ii) Gene Expression Programming (GEP). For GEP, we also experiment with the inclusion/exclusion of dropout, as well as two different evolutionary algorithms: crossover mutation and the $$(1+\lambda)$$ evolutionary algorithm. More details about our work can be found in our [poster](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/genetic-programming-poster.pdf) and our [report](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/genetic-programming-report.pdf).
