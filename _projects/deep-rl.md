This project uses reinforcement learning to master the classic Atari game of Pong, and is based on [this](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/playing-atari-with-deep-reinforcement-learning) paper by DeepMind. I had worked on this project with three colleagues of mine as part of the course CS419: Introduction to Machine Learning under Professor [Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/). The final presentation can be viewed [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/deep-rl.pdf)
