This was my first dive into the area of Image Processing. I had worked on this project with two colleagues of mine as part of the course [CS663: Digital Image Processing](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/CS663_Fall2021/) under Professor [Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/). The project mainly involved the computation of local noise variances using dynamic programming to determine whether an image is spliced.
