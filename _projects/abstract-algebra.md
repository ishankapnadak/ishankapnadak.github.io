In the summer following my sophomore year, I took up a self-paced reading project on Abstract Algebra. This was one of my first encounters with mathematical abstraction beyond freshmen courses. I enjoyed the rigor! My report could be used by virtually anyone since I start with no presumed background besides some basic math and logical skills. My (rather large!) report for the same can be viewed [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/abstract-algebra.pdf)
