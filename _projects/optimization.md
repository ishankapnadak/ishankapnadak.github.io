I am currently taking the course [EE659: A First Course in Optimization](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/courses/EE659) under Professor [Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/borkar). The course assumes familiarity with some basic real analysis and some mathematical rigor. The course is elementary in the sense that it does not use a lot of heavy machinery, but rather only some very basic results. For example, we provide a proof of the famous [Karush-Kuhn-Tucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions) conditions using nothig but the [Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem). My notes for the course can be viewed [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/optimization.pdf). Note that the course is still underway so the notes are not really complete. A more up-to-date version will always be available on my Github page and can be found [here](https://github.com/ishankapnadak/EE659-Optimization)
