We explore and implement the pix2pix architecture to solve the problem of general purpose image-to-image translation. I had worked on this project with three colleagues of mine as part of the course [CS726: Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/cs726/) under Professor [Sunia Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/). The final presentation can be viewed [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/cgans.pdf)
