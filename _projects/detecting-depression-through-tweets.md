This was one of my first projects in machine learning at IITB, as part of the course DS203: Programming for Data Science, instructed by Professors [Manjesh Hanawal](https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/mhanawal), [Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/), [Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/), and [S. Sudarshan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sudarsha/). This project was rather straightforward, where we began by building our own dataset by scraping tweets off the internet. This was followed by training various deep learning architectures (including CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, BiLSTMs) to perform classification on this dataset. A detailed report about our project can be viewed [here](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/detecting-depression-through-tweets.pdf)
