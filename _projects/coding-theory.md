I had worked on this presentation with a colleague of mine as part of the course [EE605: Error Correcting Codes](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/courses/EE605) under Professor [Nikhil Karamchandani](https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/). We looked into the use of minimal codewords in designing secret-sharing schemes with tailored access privileges. This was done by representing secrets and shares as digits of a q-ary linear code. We also looked into orthogonal arrays and how they connect to the construction of resilient functions.
