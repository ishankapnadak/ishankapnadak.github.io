As part of our course project for EECS 545: Machine Learning at the University of Michigan, my peers and I tackled the problem of Few-Shot Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning, primarily looking into [Joey Hejna's work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03363) on Few-Shot Preference-Based RL. We replicate their work as well as look into comparing various meta-learning paradigms for this task, including REPTILE, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), and an iterated variant of MAML. Details of our work can be found in our [poster](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/preference-rl-poster.pdf) and our [report](https://ishankapnadak.github.io/files/preference-rl-report.pdf). Our code is also published on [GitHub](https://github.com/5hloke/Few-Shot-Learning-RL-prior-policy).
