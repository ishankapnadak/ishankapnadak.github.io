This is an introductory course in Calculus for undergraduates in their freshmen year. 

I was a TA for the Autumn 2020 offering of this course under Professor [Ravi Ragunathan](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~ravir/). The course covers the following. 

* The convergence of sequences and series.
* A review of limits, continuity, and differentiability.
* The Mean Value Theorem, Taylor's Theorem, power series, maxima and minima.
* Riemann integrals, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, improper integrals, applications to area and volume. 
* Partial derivatives, the gradient and directional derivatives, the chain rule, maxima and minima in several variables, Lagrange multipliers.
