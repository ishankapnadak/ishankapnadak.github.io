During the Summer of 2024, I had the pleasure of working as a Research Assistant at the [Department of Statistics, University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) under the supervision of Professors [Jeffrey Regier](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/regier/) and [Camille Avestruz](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/cavestru.html) ([Department of Physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics)). I primarily worked on developing software to generate hyper-realistic astronomical images of galaxy clusters using [GalSim](https://galsim-developers.github.io/GalSim/_build/html/index.html#) with an aim to eventually detect galaxy clusters in real astronomical images. Our work follows the methodology of *forward amortized variational inference (FAVI)* to learn the parameters that best fit the generative prior distribution. [Here](https://github.com/prob-ml/bliss/tree/master/case_studies/galaxy_clustering) is a deeper look into my work.
