This is an introductory course in Complex Analysis for undergraduates in their sophomore year. 

I was a TA for the Autumn 2021 offering of this course under Professor [Sudarshan Gurjar](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~sgurjar/). The course covers the following. 

* Holomorphic and analytic functions.
* Cauchy-Riemann equations and harmonic functions. 
* Power series and their convergence via the root test and ratio test. 
* The exponential, sine, and cosine functions.
* Zeroes and poles of analytic functions.
* Cauchy's Theorem and Cauchy's Integral Formula. 
* The complex logarithm and singularities.
* Laurent Series and Cauchy's Residue Theorem.
* Evaluating Real Integrals via Cauchy's Residue Theorem.
* Some exotic results including but not limited to Liouville's Theorem, Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem, Argument Principle, Rouch√©'s Theorem, the Little and Big Picard Theorems.
* Conformal mappings.
