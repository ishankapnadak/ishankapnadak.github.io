excerpt: 'On countable and uncountable sets and their cardinalities'
---

One often encounters infinite sets in everyday life. The set of natural numbers, the set of real numbers, and so on. Although these sets are infinite, it is natural to ask if one is ''bigger'' than the other. Are two infinite sets of the same size? In the case of finite sets, comparing two cardinalities is trivial. For example, the set $$\{A,B\}$$ is smaller than the set $$\{\alpha, \beta, \gamma\}$$ since the former has two elements whereas the latter has three. Easy so far. How do we compare the size of the set of natural numbers with, say, the set of integers? One may argue that the set of natural numbers is a proper subset of the set of integers and thus it ought to be a smaller set than the set of integers. However, another person may tell you that every natural number can be paired up with a unique integer. It makes sense then that the two sets are somehow of equal size. Although counterintuitive, we use this latter definition to formalize the notion of cardinalities for infinite sets. Under this framework then, the sets $$\mathbb{N}$$ and $$\mathbb{Z}$$ are equicardinal despite one being a proper subset of the other. We formalize these ideas below and analyze the cardinalities of some commonly encountered infinite sets.
