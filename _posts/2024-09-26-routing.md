This is a fascinating topic that I learnt about and gave a lecture on as a GSI for CSE 572: Randomness & Computation in Fall 2024. Most of this material is taken from Section 4.2 of [Randomized Algorithms](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/randomized-algorithms/6A3E5CD760B0DDBA3794A100EE2843E8), by Rajeev Motwani and Prabhakar Raghavan. The Randomized Routing Algorithm is a great demonstration of why deterministic algorithms can sometimes suffer, and how a simple randomization of a deterministic algorithm helps.

### The Routing Problem.

We tackle the problem of communication in a network of parallel processors. We model our problem via a graph $$G = (V,E)$$ where vertices represent processors and edges represent communication channels. We consider the *permutation routing* problem where each node $v$ sends a packet $$p_v$$ to a unique destination $$d(v)$$ as specified by a permutation $$d \colon V \to V$$. The only two constraints we have are that (i) packets must traverse only on edges, and (ii) each edge can carry only one packet at a time. A routing scheme specifies the path that each packet takes to reach its destination with an aim to minimize the overall time taken for all packets to reach their destination. 

We focus on the hypercube graph $$\mathcal{H}_n$$ whose vertices $$V = \{0,1\}^n$$ are all possible $$n$$-bit strings and each edge allows us to flip *exactly* one bit. That is, $$(u,v)$$ is an edge iff $$u$$ and $$v$$ differ in exactly one bit. Equivalently, $$(u,v)$$ is an edge iff $$u = v \oplus e_i$$ for some unit bit vector $$e_i$$. We focus on a class of routing schemes known as *oblivious* schemes where the path for the packet $$p_v$$ depends only on the endpoints $$v$$ and $$d(v)$$ and not on any other nodes. Such schemes are easy to implement in practice. The most natural algorithm one can think of is called the **bit-fixing algorithm**. To route $$v = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$$ to $$u = (u_1, \ldots, u_n)$$, we scan the bits from left to right and ``fix'' the incorrect bits. For example, to route $$0011$$ to $$1000$$, we follow the following path
$$
    0011 \to 1011 \to 1001 \to 1000.
